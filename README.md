## Game Description
Resilire is a VR puzzle game where the players use different balls with different properties to conquer each puzzle. The target game audiences are puzzle and strategy game enthusiasts who are above 12 years old. With its unique blend of VR, puzzle levels and ball properties, Resilire can deeply attract people who are interested in solving puzzles. For the gameplay, the players need to navigate through each level and use three types of balls to overcome obstacles and enter the next level. For implementation detail, we will develop our project in Unity. For schedule, we will use the first two weeks to develop the first playable demo. For the third week, we will develop the final demo based on the feedback from the players
